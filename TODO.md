# Fix 404 Error on POST /parcels

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated frontend/src/config/api.js to use correct backend URL (https://rushdel.onrender.com)
- [x] Updated render.yaml ALLOWED_ORIGINS to include Netlify frontend URL
- [x] Verified backend has correct POST /parcels endpoint
- [x] Confirmed CORS configuration allows all origins
- [x] Verified frontend routing is correctly configured for all pages (about, schedule, admin, etc.)
- [x] Confirmed no hardcoded URLs in frontend code - all routes use relative paths

## üîÑ Next Steps
- [ ] Redeploy frontend on Netlify to pick up API URL changes
- [ ] Clear browser cache/service worker on client side
- [ ] Test parcel creation functionality
- [ ] Verify all page routes work correctly

## üìã Deployment Checklist
- [x] Frontend API configuration updated with correct backend URL
- [x] Backend CORS allows Netlify frontend
- [x] Frontend routing configured correctly for all pages
- [ ] Frontend redeployed on Netlify
- [ ] Browser cache cleared
- [ ] All routes tested

## üîç Current Status
The 404 error was caused by the frontend using a placeholder backend URL. This has been fixed by updating the API configuration. The frontend routing for all pages (about, schedule, admin, etc.) is already correctly configured using React Router with relative paths, so no additional route updates were needed.
