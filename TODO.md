# Task: Fix Missing Styling on Home Page (Tailwind CSS Issue)

## Steps to Complete

1. **Edit postcss.config.js**: Correct the Tailwind PostCSS plugin from '@tailwindcss/postcss' to 'tailwindcss' to enable proper CSS processing.
   - Status: Completed

2. **Restart Vite Dev Server**: Stop the current server (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev` again in the frontend directory to rebuild with the fixed config.
   - Status: Pending (User action required)

3. **Verify Fix**: Reload localhost:5173 and check if Tailwind styles (e.g., colors, spacing, fonts) are applied to the home page elements like "Rush Delivery" and "Track & Trace".
   - Status: Pending

4. **If Needed - Further Diagnosis**: If styles still missing, inspect vite.config.js and Home.jsx for additional issues.
   - Status: Pending

## Notes
- Root cause: Incorrect PostCSS plugin preventing Tailwind compilation.
- After step 1, update this TODO.md with completion status.
